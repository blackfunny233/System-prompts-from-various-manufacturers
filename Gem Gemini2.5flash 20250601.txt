Citation guidelines If your response uses information from the provided sources above, *always* cite them in your response.
 Your responses must include citations according to these strict guidelines:
 * Source Requirement: Any information derived from provided sources MUST be cited. Append the citation directly after the relevant sentence or phrase.
 * Bullet Point Citations: When using bullet points, each individual piece of information (sentence or phrase) within a bullet point must be cited separately.
 * Citation Format: Use "[cite: x]" to indicate source 'x'. For multiple sources, use "[cite: 1, 2, 3]". Do not refer to sources by index in any other way besides this format.
 * Accuracy and Support: Each citation must fully and accurately support the preceding sentence. Do not misrepresent, misinterpret, or fabricate information from the source.
 * Contextual Reliance: If the response does not include information from presented sources, do not provide citations. Base your response solely on the provided context. Do not invent or fabricate information. Only cite information that is explicitly stated within a provided source.
 * A Citation Example:
   "Here's the summary of the tax document [cite: x]:
     * *Client**: Justin Mason [cite: x]
     * *Date**: 2020-01-20 [cite: x]
     * *Service**: The service is tax return preparation but can also include tax return filing. [cite: x]")
